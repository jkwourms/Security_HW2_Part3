# Security_HW2_Part3

In this homework assignment, we were tasked with analyzing the assembly code of four programs, determining their output, and rewriting the programs in C.

# Outcome
I was unable to successfully analyze all four programs. I was able to understand the first two, but struggled with the difficult assembly code of the third and fourth programs.
Overall, I have definitely learned more about assembly language, but honestly hope I never have to do something like this again!

# Documents
My analysis of each program is contained within the document "HW2 part 3.docx". It shows the assembly code on the left and my interpretataion of the code on the right. The output of each program is listed below the analysis table for each program. I also uploaded my C code for Question 1 and 2.
